## Challenge - 005

This challenge aims to familiarize developers with the FLIP (First, Last, Invert, Play) technique, facilitating seamless transitions between two visible HTML elements on a web page using JavaScript.

## Tasks

- Create a web page with two distinct HTML elements.
- Implement the FLIP technique to smoothly transition between these elements.
- On interaction (e.g., click), smoothly transform one element into another with an animated transition.

# Hints

Consider utilizing `transform`, `opacity`, and `transition` properties in CSS for smoother visual transitions.
