## Challenge - 006

This challenge introduces developers to the @container CSS rule, an alternative approach to @media query for creating responsive designs.

## Task

- Design a web layout that requires responsiveness based on various screen sizes.
- Implement the @container rule to achieve responsiveness without relying solely on @media query.
- Ensure the layout adjusts dynamically based on the container's width rather than specific device breakpoints (viewport breakpoints).
